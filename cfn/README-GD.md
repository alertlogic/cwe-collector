# guardduty.template

Alert Logic Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudWatch Events (CWE) Collector CloudFormation template.

# Overview

This folder contains the AWS CWE JavaScript lambda function and the CloudFormation template (CFT) that deploys the GuardDuty events collector to AWS. The GuardDuty collector collects and forwards CloudWatch events to the Cloud Insight backend for display as threats on the Incidents page.

Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that requires no customer-managed hardware or software. 
GuardDuty analyzes and processes VPC Flow Logs and AWS CloudTrail event logs. GuardDuty uses security logic and 
AWS usage statistics techniques to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity. 
Such activity includes escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials, or communication with 
malicious IPs, URLs, or domains. GuardDuty informs you of the status of your AWS infrastructure and applications by producing security `findings`. 

# Before you begin

This procedure requires administrative permissions in AWS and your Alert Logic Cloud Insight account.  You also need to download the Alert Logic custom CFT to your local machine from [the Alert Logic public github repository](https://github.com/alertlogic/cwe-collector/blob/master/cfn/guardduty.template).

Windows systems also require PowerShell version 3.0 or later. If you have an earlier version of PowerShell, we suggest you [upgrade it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell#upgrading-existing-windows-powershell) to version 3.0 or later. 

# Installation

To install the GuardDuty events collector:

1. **Enable CloudWatch event collection** - In your AWS account, enable Amazon GuardDuty CloudWatch event collection.
1. **Alert Logic Access key creation** - Create an Alert Logic access key that allows the collector to connect to the Alert Logic Cloud Insight back end.
1. **CloudFormation template deployment** - Deploy a custom AWS CloudFormation template to your AWS account to create lambda functions.
1. **Deployment verification** - Use the Cloud Insight console to verify a successful installation.

## Enable CloudWatch event collection

The Alert Logic CWE collector for GuardDuty collects `findings` from Amazon CloudWatch events.

To enable Amazon GuardDuty events, see [Setting Up Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_settingup.html).

## Alert Logic Access key creation

### Verify permissions

Log into the Cloud Insight console as an administrator [here](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/#/login) to verify administrator permissions:

1. In the Cloud Insight console, click the user name at the top-right corner.
1. In the drop-down menu, click **Users**.
1. Select the user in `AIMS User` section. **Note:** you can start typing a name in the search box to find the appropriate user.
1. Verify the `user role` as listed under `Edit an AIMS User` has the `Administrator` role selected.

### Key creation

Use the instructions below that match your operating system: Unix (MacOS, Linux) or Windows.

#### Unix (MacOS, Linux)

The following procedure assumes a Unix-based local machine using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

From the bash command line, type the following commands, where `<email address>` is the Alert Logic Cloud Insight email address you use to log in. Enter your password when prompted.

```
export AL_USERNAME='<email address>'
auth=$(curl -X POST -s -u $AL_USERNAME https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/authenticate); export AL_ACCOUNT_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.account.id'); export AL_USER_ID=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.user.id'); export AL_TOKEN=$(echo $auth | jq -r '.authentication.token'); if [ -z $AL_TOKEN ]; then echo "Authentication failure"; else roles=$(curl -s -X GET -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/roles | jq -r '.roles[].name'); if [ "$roles" != "Administrator" ]; then echo "The $AL_USERNAME doesn’t have Administrator role. Assigned role is '$roles'"; else curl -s -X POST -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys | jq .; fi; fi; unset AL_USERNAME;
```
An example of a successful response is:

```
{
  "access_key_id": "712c0b413eef41f6",
  "secret_key": "1234567890b3eea8880d292fb31aa96902242a076d3d0e320cc036eb51bf25ad"
}
```

Make a note of the `access_key_id` and `secret_key` values, which you need to deploy the CloudFormation template to your AWS account. 

**Necessary role error**

If the command returns an error about not having the necessary role, please verify your Alert Logic account has administrator permissions. Click [here](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/api/aims/) for more information about AIMS APIs.

**"Limit exceeded" error**

Each user can create only five access keys. If a "limit exceeded" response appears, you must delete one or more access keys before you can create new keys. 

1. Type the following command to list access keys:
    ```
    curl -s -X GET -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys | jq
    ```
1. Use the selected access_key_id in the following command to delete the key:
    ```
    curl -X DELETE -H "x-aims-auth-token: $AL_TOKEN" https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys/<ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE>
    ```


#### Windows

**Note:** These instructions require PowerShell 3.0 or later.

In the PowerShell console, please type the following commands. Enter your Alert Logic Cloud Insight email address and password when prompted.

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; $creds = Get-Credential -Message "Please enter your Alert Logic Cloud Insight email address and password"; $unsecureCreds = $creds.GetNetworkCredential(); $base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(("{0}:{1}" -f $unsecureCreds.UserName,$unsecureCreds.Password))); Remove-Variable unsecureCreds; $AUTH = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Headers @{"Authorization"=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)} -Uri https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/authenticate ; Remove-Variable base64AuthInfo; $AL_ACCOUNT_ID = $AUTH.authentication.account.id; $AL_USER_ID = $AUTH.authentication.user.id; $AL_TOKEN = $AUTH.authentication.token; if (!$AL_TOKEN) { Write-Host "Authentication failure"} else { $ROLES_RESP = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Headers @{"x-aims-auth-token"=$AL_TOKEN} -Uri https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/roles ; $ROLES = $ROLES_RESP.roles.name; if ($ROLES -ne "Administrator" ) { Write-Host "Your user doesn’t have Administrator role. Assigned role is '$ROLES'" } else { $ACCESS_KEY = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Headers @{"x-aims-auth-token"=$AL_TOKEN} -Uri https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys ; Write-Host $ACCESS_KEY } }
```

An example of a successful response is:

```
@{access_key_id=712c0b413eef41f6; secret_key=1234567890b3eea8880d292fb31aa96902242a076d3d0e320cc036eb51bf25ad}
```

Make a note of the `access_key_id` and `secret_key` values, which you need to deploy the CloudFormation template to your AWS account.

**Necessary role error**

If the command returns an error about not having the necessary role, please verify your Alert Logic account has administrator permissions. Click [here](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/api/aims/) for more information about AIMS APIs.

**"Limit exceeded" error**

Each user can create only five access keys. If a "limit exceeded" response appears, you must delete one or more access keys before you can create new keys.

1. Type the following command to list access keys:
    ```
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Headers @{"x-aims-auth-token"=$AL_TOKEN} -Uri https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys
    ```
1. Use the selected `access_key_id` in the following command to delete the key:
    ```
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Delete -Headers @{"x-aims-auth-token"=$AL_TOKEN} -Uri https://api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com/aims/v1/$AL_ACCOUNT_ID/users/$AL_USER_ID/access_keys/<ACCESS_KEY_ID_HERE>
    ```


## CloudFormation template deployment

The Alert Logic CWE collector deploys to a single AWS region. To collect from 
multiple AWS regions, you must either install the collector in each target region or 
set up GuardDuty collection across regions. For more information, see: [Setting up GuardDuty across
regions and accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_accounts.html).

### Use the Amazon console to deploy

**Note:** This procedure assumes setup in the AWS `us-east-1` region using the Alert Logic Cloud Insight [US console](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/#/login). If your setup is in a European region (e.g., `eu-east-1`), use the [UK console](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.co.uk/#/login).

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) with an AWS account that has AWS administrator privileges. 
1. Select the region in which you want to deploy the CFT.
1. Click **Services**->**CloudFormation**->**Create Stack**.
1. In the `Choose a template` section select **Specify an Amazon S3 template URL** and enter the following URL.
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/alertlogic-collectors-us-east-1/cfn/guardduty.template`
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the `Specify Details` window, provide the following required parameters:
   - `Stack name` - Any name you have used for creating an AWS stack
   - `AccessKeyId` - `access_key_id` returned from AIMs [above](#alert-logic-access-key-creation)
   - `AlApiEndpoint` - usually `api.global-services.global.alertlogic.com` 
   - `AlDataResidency` - usually `default`
   - `SecretKey` - `secret_key` returned from AIMs [above](#alert-logic-access-key-creation)
1. Click **Next**. 
1. On the `Options` panel, click **Next**.
1. In the `Review` panel, perform a predeployment check. 
1. Select **"I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources"**, then click **Create**.
1. On the CloudFormation, `Stacks` panel, filter based on the stack name you created, and then 
select your stack by name.

If the deployment was successful, the status appears as: CREATE_COMPLETE. If the deployment was not successful, 
see [Troubleshooting Installation Issues](#troubleshooting-installation-issues) below.

**Note:** Only one collector installation is allowed per AWS region. If you try to deploy the template multiple times in the same region, if will fail with the following error:

Status | Type | Logical ID | Status Reason
--|--|--|--
CREATE_FAILED | AWS::Lambda::Function | CollectLambdaFunction | alertlogic-cwe-collector already exists in stack arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:123456789101:stack/test-one/f9536300-d12b-11e7-ac98-50d5cd16c68e


### Use a Command Line to deploy

Follow these steps to deploy the Alert Logic custom template using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

1. In the command line, type the following command, where the required parameters are:
    - `stack-name` - Any name you have used to create an AWS stack
    - `AccessKeyId` - `access_key_id` returned from AIMs [above](#alert-logic-access-key-creation)
    - `SecretKey` - `secret_key` returned from AIMs [above](#alert-logic-access-key-creation)

    ```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/alertlogic-collectors-us-east-1/cfn/guardduty.template --stack-name <alertlogic-collector-stack-name> --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --parameters ParameterKey=AccessKeyId,ParameterValue=<access_key_id> ParameterKey=SecretKey,ParameterValue=<secret_key>
    ```
1. Wait for the stack creation to complete.

## Deployment verification

1. Log into the Alert Logic Cloud Insight console using an account that has administrator permissions.
    - Use the [US console](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.com/#/login) for regions in the US and associated geographical regions.
    - Use the [UK console](https://console.cloudinsight.alertlogic.co.uk/#/login) for regions in Europe and other regions not in the US.
1. If you have not already created a Cloud Insight deployment, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.alertlogic.com/gsg/amazon-web-services-cloud-insight-get-started.htm) to do so for the AWS account and region where you installed the CFT.
1. Verify successful deployment by checking the Incident list in the Alert Logic Cloud Insight UI. The list should be populated with Incidents that correspond to recent Amazon GuardFindings, which are displayed in the Amazon GuardDuty console.

## Troubleshooting installation issues

If installation through the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) is not successful, you can access 
`CloudFormation`->`Stacks`->`Stack Detail` (by selecting your stack name from the list) to see detailed
error messages in the AWS [CloudWatch Log Stream](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home). Click `Logs`, 
and then filter by `/aws/lambda/my-new-stack` (where `my-new-stack` is the name you gave your stack). 

If installation through the AWS CLI is not successful, issue the following command for more information:

```
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name my-new-stack
```

1. If `GetEndpointsLambdaFunction` fails, an issue could exist with the `access_key_id` or the `secret_key`
 you provided. Be sure the `access_key_id` is correct, your `secret_key` is valid, and your user account has administrative permissions for the Alert Logic Cloud Insight account.
1. Other issues, TBD.
